AUTHOR:         John Singer, et. al.
PUROSE:         As we're migrating from BF to SCCM, etc, we needed a place to store all
                our custom-content to date.  Here 'tis:
				
				We initially start with some Powershell, Python, and BigFix scripts/fixlets.                Particularly, we have a couple of .csv files, extracted by ReST client
                which contain:
                        1) Fixlets (relevance, scripts and names), and
                        2) Properties

                'In the fullness of time', we shall translate the most salient to
                PowerShell.

Enjoy!
